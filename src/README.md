# Starting source code

This directory contains the code to use for starting your project.  It contains the following files:

* index.html - HTML file for the application
* tse.css - style sheet for the application
* tse.js - main application code where most changes will be made
* apis/classes.js - contains classes to handle JSON content from ThoughtSpot
* apis/rest-api.js - contains wrapper classes for calling some ThoughtSpot web services
* images/* - images used for this project

You may want to copy this folder (and sub-folder) to a working project location in case you need to revert to the original.  Or you can always do a fresh pull from GitHub.
